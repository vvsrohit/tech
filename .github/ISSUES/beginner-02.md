# Beginner: Shorten the hero subtitle in `src/app/page.js`

Description
--
The hero subtitle is a bit long. Shorten or simplify the subtitle in `src/app/page.js` so it reads clearly on small screens.

Acceptance criteria
--
- Update the subtitle string in `src/app/page.js` to be <= 120 characters.
- No layout regressions on desktop/mobile.

Notes
--
- Edit only the text string; CSS or layout changes are not required.
