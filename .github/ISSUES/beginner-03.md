# Beginner: Add or verify `alt` text for images

Description
--
Check the images used by the landing page (`public/` and `src/app/page.js`) and ensure each `<Image />` or `<img>` has meaningful `alt` text. If an image is purely decorative, mark it with an empty alt (`alt=""`).

Acceptance criteria
--
- All images referenced in `src/app/page.js` have `alt` attributes.
- The PR shows the updated `alt` attributes.

Notes
--
- This is a small accessibility improvement and great first issue for contributors.
