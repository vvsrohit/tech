<!-- Beginner issue: tiny CSS tweak -->
# Beginner: Slightly increase speaker card border-radius

Description
--
Adjust the speaker card styles in `src/app/globals.css` to increase the border-radius for speaker cards so they look softer on the page.

Acceptance criteria
--
- Add or modify a CSS rule in `src/app/globals.css` that targets the speaker card (e.g., `.speaker-card`) and sets `border-radius: 12px;` (or similar).
- Visual check in the dev server shows the rounded corners.

Notes
--
- This is a small styling tweak and safe for beginners.
