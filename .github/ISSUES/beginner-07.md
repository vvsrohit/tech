<!-- Beginner issue: add sponsor logo placeholder -->
# Beginner: Add a sponsor logo placeholder in `public/` and update sponsors list

Description
--
Add a small placeholder image file (e.g., `public/sponsor-example.png`) and update the sponsors section in `src/app/page.js` to include it (simple `<Image />` tag). The placeholder can be a tiny square image or PNG.

Acceptance criteria
--
- A placeholder image is added to `public/` (contributors can add any small image).
- `src/app/page.js` is updated to reference the image in the Sponsors section.

Notes
--
- If the contributor cannot create an image, they can instead add the `<Image />` tag with an existing public image path.
