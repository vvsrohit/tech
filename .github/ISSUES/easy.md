# Easy: Update landing page copy

Description
--
The landing page currently uses placeholder text. Replace or improve the copy for the hero section and speaker blurbs to better match the IEEE Dholakpur event tone. This is an easy task suitable for a first-time contributor.

Acceptance criteria
--
- The hero title and subtitle are revised with clearer messaging.
- Speaker names and short bios are realistic (can remain fictitious).
- No layout or style regressions on desktop.

Notes
--
- Editing `src/app/page.js` is sufficient.
